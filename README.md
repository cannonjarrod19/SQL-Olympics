# SQL-Olympics

I found a dataset covering the Olympics and wanted to test my SQL skills.
I first looked through the different columns to better understand the information as a whole. I then went through and answered specific questions that required me to use different SQL skills in order to pull out the correct information thats answers the question. This serves as a good example of my current SQL skills and the potential for further growth..
